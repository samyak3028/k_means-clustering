# k_means-clustering

#### Simple k-means clustering (centroid-based) using Python

## Code Requirements

#### Python 3.5
#### Numpy 1.11.0

## Description
#### k-Means clustering is one of the most popular clustering methods in data mining and also in unsupervised machine learning.In this area of machine learning,we will have the data, but we donâ€™t have any target variable as in the case of supervised learning. So the goal here is to observe the hidden patterns among the data and group them into clusters

##### Firstly we have to intitilize cluster centre for each cluster.
##### Secondly for each data point we need to take eucledian distance.
##### Thirdly adjust the centroids.
##### Fourthly repeat this process till cluster are well seperated.
